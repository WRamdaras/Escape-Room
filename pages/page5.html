                    As Kratos got the revenge he wanted, he still didn't feel satisfied.<br>
                    Kratos lived his life with regret and hate<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All he wanted is to see his family again... </br>
                    <br>
                    Kratos decided to talk with the god of death... <br>
                    He talked with her and demanded for her to bring his family back <br>
                    <br><br>
                    She told Kratos that It's simply impossible to do without... <br>
                    her getting heavily punished by Odin, the uppergod<br>
                    <br>
                    Kratos was angry, and had a debate with the goddess. <br>
                    What would happen If I killed Odin? <br>
                    <br><br>
                    The goddess was shocked and didn't know what to say<br>
                    Kratos grabbed his gear and eventually, started a new journey. <br>
